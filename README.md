# TestFinance1

We are creating a mock market with at least 3 stocks' price history from July 7, 2016 to July 6, 2017.  The host (client) will be able to send a transaction data file to the central server. 
The central server will keep a record of the trade history of each client and track trades as they are processed, as well as processing the trades.
